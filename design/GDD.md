**Title:** Koishi Eyes Shut Paradigm (KESP)

**Platform:** Gameboy color (emulation)

**Genre:** Platformer

**Target:** General public (3+)


## Concept
The concept is to create a small-sized platformer which will blend both action and puzzle elements through the readapted mechanic of Ikaruga.

### Synopsis
Koishi's third eye has been stolen, she cannot avoid conscious beings with her eyes open. To find back her third eye, she must go deep down to hell and retrieve it.

### Unique Selling Points
- Touhou
- platformer with an Ikaruga mechanic of gameplay
- Could have some puzzle mechanics

### Game objectives
- Go down each level and survive.
- Beat the boss of each level (as of now, Orin, Satori, Marisa(?))

### Graphics
- Given the hardware, the pixel art will be minimalistic, and is reduced to 8 palettes (of 4 colours, transparent included in 8x8 squares) that can be displayed at a time.
- Traditional side view, typical of any platformer
- HUD: Health, Eye open/closed

### Data storage:
Data storage is handled by the GBC emulator.

## GAMEPLAY
### Basic mechanics
- Health: 3 hearts, if you get hit 3 times you die
- Eyes: bait (?)

### Unique mechanic: Dimension-shift
Koishi can close her eyes to acces the spiritual world. She can turn back anytime to the real world by opening her eyes.
- __Real world:__ You cannot interact with spiritual entities, but you cannot go through real-world entities.
- __Spiritual world:__ You will become intangible to real world hazards, however monters will come at you. Spiritual platforms and items will become available.

With an item, you could bait monsters elsewhere while you are eyes closed.

With an item, you could freeze time while eyes closed.

### Obstacles
- Regular terrain, tangible in both worlds
